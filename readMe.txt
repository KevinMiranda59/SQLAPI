Howdy Tony!! This is an API I made to fetch data from the included database using url PULL requests. If you want to see examples of my SQL they live in Controllers\customer.ts,
 but if you're interested in the API setup check out my server.ts and mysql.ts. 

 This API has two urls that retrieve two inner joins and outputs JSON objects that can easily be destructured and input into other functions.
